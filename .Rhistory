##We then produced tables to clarify the required demographic data. Specifically, we are looking for what number is populated by observations. This information allows us to then subset the data from the larger data set that are organized by race and sex.
##This table tells us which single digit number represents the racial/sex level of the STUB_NAME variable.

## With a similar principle to the previous table, we produced this one to see which specific number corresponds to a specific racial/sex pairing, like Black male, for example. We measure this correspondence by whether or not a number has observations under a specific label. If this number has observations, this indicates that it represents the given racial/sex pairing.
table(drug_exam$STUB_LABEL_NUM, drug_exam$STUB_LABEL)

We then create a new variable that explicitly states these race/sex pairings and produce a subset that focuses on this new variable.
## We make another subset that disaggregates race and sex so that we can perform a 2-way ANOVA to see if these two variables are statistically significant predictors for drug overdose mortality.
