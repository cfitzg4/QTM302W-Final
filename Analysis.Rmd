## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
suicide <- read_csv("suicide_data.csv")
suicide1 <- read_csv("data/pc.csv")
getwd()
##use ".." to get to project level data 
##put "data/" before csv file name if data is in "data" folder 
renv::snapshot()
renv::restore()
renv::hydrate()

##GH:hosting"remotes"
##clone:local copy of remote
##remote is "origin"
##fork: copy repo on GH
##commit: creating a snapshot of changes
##push: update remote repository with local changed
##can't always push after commit, need to pull before pushing to update repo
##pull: update local repo with commits pushed by others 
```
hello!

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
