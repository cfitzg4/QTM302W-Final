## Project Objectives
With this project we intend to understand how and why certain groups are more at risk of dying from opioids. From acquiring this information, we hope to enable targeted interventions to help reduce the spread and magnitude of the opioid epidemic. 

## Methods
We utilize ANOVA to complete our statistical analyses for this project. The nature of our data is primarily categorical, with our outcome variable being the only numerical. As such, multivariate ANOVA tests are the optimal way to complete our inquiry. 

## Platforms & Language
To complete this project, we rely upon RStudio, specifically RMarkdown, to code necessary statistical tests and visualizations, as well as writing up relevant summaries and descriptions to accompany and clarify the code. We use Github to make this project publically available. As such, we also use HTML. 


## Project Description 
### Research Question
How do race, ethnicity, and gender contribute to variations in opioid-related mortalities?

### Models and Visualizations 
Given the format of the data we largely use bar graphs. On the x-axis for these graphs are either year or opioid type. Along the Y-axis is always the estimated rate of overdose. This allows us to see the variation of mortality over time and opioid type. Bar graphs also allow us to show the differences between certain demographic groups, like race, ethnicity, and sex which are relevant to our inquiry. 

### Challenges
The formatting of the data itself proved to be troublesome. While we did manage to clean the data enough to be usable for our intended analyses, we were unable to explore variation among age *and* race, ethnicity, and sex, which was our original objective. Moreover, our data is restricted purely to mortality, as our data set is compiled form death certificate information. 

### Future Directions 
We hope do do more exploration, focusing on cultural meanings and influences for certain enthoracial and sex groups. For example, access to medical care, which has been found to vary among different racial/ethnic groups could be contributing to variation in mortality. This is because opioid abuse often begins from prescribed usage per a medical professional. However, given that our data is from death certificates it is extremely difficult to ascertain how an individual ended up dying, as we can only see what drug is responsible for their death.
